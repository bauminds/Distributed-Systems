Your new goal for Project #4 is to integrate the capability to ensure continual operation of your KV-store despite replica failures.  To achieve this goal you will implement Paxos to realize fault-tolerant consensus amongst your replicated servers.  Functionally, you must implement and integrate the Paxos roles we described in class, and as described in the Lamport papers, including the Proposers, Acceptors, and Learners.  The goal here is to focus on the Paxos implementation and algorithmic steps involved in realizing consensus in event ordering. Client threads may generate requests to any of the replicas at any time.  To minimize the potential for live lock, you may choose to use leader election amongst the proposers, however, that is not a strict requirement of the project.
