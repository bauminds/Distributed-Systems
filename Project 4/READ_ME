Your new goal for Project #4 is to integrate the capability to ensure continual operation of your KV-store despite replica ＜/br＞
failures.  To achieve this goal you will implement Paxos to realize fault-tolerant consensus amongst your replicated servers.  ＜/br＞
Functionally, you must implement and integrate the Paxos roles we described in class, and as described in the Lamport papers, ＜/br＞
including the Proposers, Acceptors, and Learners.  The goal here is to focus on the Paxos implementation and algorithmic steps＜/br＞ 
involved in realizing consensus in event ordering. Client threads may generate requests to any of the replicas at any＜/br＞
time.  To minimize the potential for live lock, you may choose to use leader election amongst the proposers, however, that ＜/br＞
is not a strict requirement of the project.
